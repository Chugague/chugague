# 👋 Hello! I'm Kevin Ugalde

Welcome to my GitHub snowpark! I'm carving my way through the slopes of DevOps and Software Development with a passion for building impactful applications and scalable infrastructure.

Currently working 50% as a Software Developer and 50% as a DevOps Engineer, I’m combining the best of both worlds to deliver secure, automated, and cloud-ready solutions.

## 🧭 What I'm Doing Now

### 👨‍💻 **Frontend Development**
- Developing enterprise-level **Angular applications** with **microfrontend architecture**
- Implementing **role-based authentication and routing** using **MSAL** and **Azure AD**
- Managing inter-microfrontend communication via **PubSub patterns**
- Applying security headers and CSP for frontend containers using **NGINX**
- Writing **unit tests with Karma and Jasmine**, following a consistent testing architecture

### ⚙️ **DevOps & Cloud Engineering**
- Automating pipelines with **Azure DevOps** and **GitHub Actions**
- Managing infrastructure using **Terraform** on **Azure** and **AWS (ECS, RDS, S3)**
- Performing security scanning with **OWASP ZAP**, **Snyk**, **Trivy**, and **Dependency-Check**
- Deploying Java backends in **on-premise servers** using **Podman** and `podman-compose`

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 📦 Microfrontend Platform in Azure
> Designed and implemented a secure microfrontend architecture in Angular. Each microfrontend runs as an isolated container in Azure Container Apps, authenticated with Azure AD and managed via MSAL. Communicates using a shared PubSub service.

### 🔐 CI/CD Pipeline with Security Scanning
> Fully automated CI/CD pipeline using Azure DevOps. Integrated Trivy, Snyk, and OWASP ZAP with custom reporting (SARIF to HTML). Configured secure NGINX environments for development and QA.

### 🌐 Hybrid Architecture Deployment
> Developed a backend in Java deployed to on-premise servers using Podman. Frontend lives in Azure, connected securely through public endpoints and protected APIs. Automated deployment via GitHub Actions and private container registry.

### ⚙️ Terraform AWS Infrastructure (DevOps Challenge)
> Infrastructure-as-Code project for deploying a containerized frontend in AWS using ECS Fargate, RDS, Load Balancer, and GitHub Actions. Created as part of a technical challenge for a DevOps role at PagerDuty.
